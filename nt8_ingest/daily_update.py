"""Daily incremental updater for nt8_ohlcv_bars.

Pulls a short TRAILING window of every currently-trading contract (+ the next
contract in each roll cycle) for the six instruments from the NT8 bridge and
upserts them idempotently. Meant to run once a day during the CME maintenance
break (16:00-17:00 CT), when the Globex trade-date has just closed at 16:00 CT
so the session is complete and no bar is half-formed.

Design:
  - Active contracts are read from the DB (contracts with bars in the last
    LOOKBACK_DAYS), i.e. ground truth of what is trading -- no per-instrument
    expiry math. The next contract in each cycle is seeded so a roll is caught
    early. On a cold DB it falls back to the schedule's nearest upcoming months.
  - TRAIL_DAYS trailing window => a missed run self-heals on the next day, and
    roll-overlap bars keep landing on BOTH contracts (matches the archive rule).
  - Idempotent: INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (symbol,contract,ts) DO NOTHING.
  - Single-vendor: only adds bars NT8/Tradovate returns; never fills gaps.

Usage:
    python daily_update.py            # run the update (what the scheduler calls)
    python daily_update.py --dry      # show which contracts/window, pull nothing
